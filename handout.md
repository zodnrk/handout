# Maven
## Build tool
Maven is a powerful build tool for java projects.
It is used to manage and describe:

 - Standard life cycle for projects (compile, test, package, deploy)
 - Structuring projects (predefined file structure)
 - Definition and management of project dependencies
 - Version management of dependencies
 - Creation of projects from templates

Maven can scope dependencies to be included on:

 - Compilation
 - Runtime
 - Provided (only to compile, not on runtime. Example: Servlet API)
 - Test (dependency is only included for automated testing. Example: JUnit)

## Configuration file: pom.xml
The `pom.xml` is a **p**roject **o**bject **m**odel with xml format.

Example `pom.xml`
```xml
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
      <version>5.2.9.RELEASE</version>
      </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>
```

While the dependencies are probably the most useful, but still optional
feature of maven, the following properties are mandatory:

 - `groupId`  - package path of the project
 - `artifactId`  - name of your project
 - `version`  - a version your project.

Via the `pom.xml` it is also possible the specify
arbitrary code repositories, custom plugins, project
inheritance etc. Any details may be found in the official
[introduction](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html).

## File structure
Maven embraces the convention over configuration principle. This incites to
adhere to the following file structure:
```
src
    src/main
        src/main/java
        src/main/resources
    src/test
        src/test/java
target
    target/classes
```

 - `src` - all source code
 - `src/main/java` - entry point for the applications source
 - `src/main/resources` - other files that are needed at runtime
 - `src/test` - anything related to automated tests
 - `src/test/java` - the test sources (p.ex. JUnit classes)

## Quick start guide
* Get and install maven: [maven.apache.org](http://maven.apache.org/)
* `mvn validate` - check if configuration is valid and all necessary
information is available
* `mvn compile` - does what is says :)
* `mvn test` - runs automated tests (if set up)
* `mvn package` - builds your `.jar`, `.war` or whatever you've configured
* `mvn deploy` - ships your package
* `mvn clean` - removes all (intermediate) build files


# Git
## Further Reading
For further reading about Git,
I recommend the book _Pro Git_.
It's free, and can be found on [the Git
website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
If you're looking for something in video form,
[Lecture 6 of _The Missing
Semester_](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)
is also quite good.

## History
Git is an open source version control system (VCS),
which was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005
because the current VCS used for Linux Kernel development
was no longer sufficient.
^[[git-scm.com A short 
history](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git)]
Some of the goals for Git were:

* Speed
* Simple design
* Support for parallel development
* Fully distributed
* Efficiently handle large projects

## Quick Start Guide
* Get and install Git:
[git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* `git clone git@github.com/dude/project` - get a local copy of the project
* `git fetch` - get the latest changes from the server, without applying
them to your working copy
* `git status` - list the changes on your working copy and show, if they
are included in your next commit
* `git add <pathspec>` - add the specified file (also multiple files and
globing allowed) to the next commit (stage the file)
* `git restore --staged <pathspec>` - remove the specified file from the commit
list (unstage the file), but keep the local changes
* `git commit -m <message>` - commit the staged files and add the specified
commit message
* `git diff` - show changes between the latest commit and the working copy
* `git push` - send the commits of the current branch to the repository
* `git pull` - get the latest commits of the current branch from the repository
* `git checkout <branch>` - switch to the specified branch. Use `-b` to
create a new branch

## Version Control
Version control systems (VCS) serve mainly two purposes:

1) Keeping track of every change that happens to the code
2) Facilitate simultaneous edition (by multiple programmers) of the same
project

Thanks to VCS it is possible to easily revert to any revision ever made,
find out when exactly a feature (or bug) was introduced etc. Further more,
it is also possible to see, who wrote what and when.

The fantastic merging capabilities introduced with Git enable programmers to
easily unify their working copies without overwriting each others changes. This
outstanding feature made Git the most popular VCS today. Still, every
programmer has its own version, but Git simplifies merging these versions
into a new, combined one.

## Branching Model
Apart of the very source of truth, the `main` (or `master`) branch, Git
allows to have some diverging source trees called branches. Branches allow
to make and test some changes, without messing with the main code. A branch
can be imagined as if it would be a completely separated copy of the code.

It is very common to develop new features in a dedicated branch. This brings
the advantage, that e.g. an unfinished feature doesn't block the development
of a hot-fix in the main branch.

Branches can easily be compared and merged. The hot-fix from above could
therefore be merged into the feature branch, so the feature could be finished
and tested already with the hot-fix included, before being merged back into
the main branch.

## Collaboration

## Data Model

## Tooling
### Git Clients
There are several ways to use Git:

- The default command line program
- [Tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig): A command line wrapper, for a better UI
- Various GUIs:
  * [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  * [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/)
  * [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

While it may seem easier to use a GUI while learning Git,
it is generally recommended to start with the command line version.
This will help you get familiar with how git works on the inside,
which is valuable knowledge should you ever need to perform some
more complex operations or fix a messed up state in your repository.

### Merge Tools
In order to resolve merge conflicts,
it may sometimes be helpful to have a more powerful tool than
your text-editor or IDE.
There are several options available, that have differing features.
Here are some to try out:

- [Meld](https://github.com/yousseb/meld)
- [KDiff3](https://github.com/KDE/kdiff3)
- [Diffuse](https://github.com/MightyCreak/diffuse)

After [configuring](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool)
the tool you'd like to use, you can simply type
`git mergetool` when the working tree is in a conflicted state.
Git will then automatically guide you through the merge
using the configured tool.
