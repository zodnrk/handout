# Git
## Further Reading
For further reading about git,
I recommend the book _Pro Git_.
It's free, and can be found on [the Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
If you're looking for something in video form,
[Lecture 6 of _The Missing Semester_](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)
is also quite good.

## History

## Version Control

## Branching Model

## Collaboration

## Data Model

## Tooling
